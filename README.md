His current work relates to using Big Data for the early signs of illness. A key objective of any health care system is not only to overcome illnesses as it happens, but to be able to predict the early on-set of illness. The proposed research will develop and extend the current study into Frailty encompassing not only clinical factors, but economic, environmental and social factors.  Current estimates suggest that 7% of the population over 65 years of age exhibit signs of frailty.
