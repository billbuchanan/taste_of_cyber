# 5. Digital Forensics
This topic is presented by Sean McKeown

## Learning Outcomes
The key learning outcomes of this unit are:

*Gain a high level understanding of what Digital Forensics entails
*Develop an understanding of Web Browser Forensics
*Develop an understanding of Image and EXIF metadata forensics
*Develop an understanding of data hiding approaches


## Morning Session
In the morning session we will look briefly at what the Digital Forensics process is and how investigators handle evidence.
We will then look at the forensic traces left by Web browsers for a mock investigation.

## Afternoon Session
In the afternoon session we will look at artefacts which are embedded in images creates by a digital camera or mobile phone, before looking at some simple methods for hiding data.

## Resources
The resources for both sessions can be found in the "Morning Session" and "Afternoon Session" folders on this Github page. 
This includes both the presentation powerpoint slides, the practical worksheets, and the evidence files used during the workshop.
